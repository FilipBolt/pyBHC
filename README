pyBHC - Bayesian Hierarchical clustering in python
============================================================

Author - Stuart Sale

Intro
------------

This is python module to perform Bayesian hierarchical clustering 
in python.

It implements both vanilla BHC, as described in Heller & Ghahramani 
(2005a), and randomised BHC, which is described in Heller & Ghahramani 
(2005b).
